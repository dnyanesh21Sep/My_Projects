# ðŸ“š C++ Data Structures Library

A comprehensive and reusable C++ library offering generic implementations of major data structures. Designed with object-oriented principles, this project simplifies learning and using data structures in real-world applications.

---

## ðŸš€ Technology

- **Language:** C++
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Concepts:** Templates, Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This project serves as a foundational **data structures library** that provides:

- Ready-to-use implementations of **linear** and **non-linear** data structures
- Generic coding using **templates** for supporting all data types
- Both **fundamental** and **advanced** operations included
- Code designed with clarity, reusability, and modularity in mind

## ðŸ§° Features

### âœ… Linear Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stack
- Queue (Simple, Circular, Deque)

### ðŸŒ² Non-Linear Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST, AVL Tree)
- Heaps (Max/Min Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix)

### ðŸ’¡ Additional Highlights
- Search & Sort Algorithms
- Recursion & Backtracking utilities
- Traversal operations (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, BFS, DFS)
